            <h2>Australian Rainfall</h2>
            <p>
              Rainfall in <p2>Australia</p2> varies greatly across the country. Northern Queensland often experiences the highest rainfall in the country. 
              As can be seen on the graph to the right, this is shown that the highest rainfall in the country is held there. 
              There is also a trend of having higher rainfall in the Eastern states which can be seen clearly. 
            The West coast also experiences rainfall, but far less than 1000mm per year, which in comparison to the East coast is quite small.  </p>

          <h2>Rainfall varies with Temperatures</h2>
          <p>
          It's often been speculated that rainfall varies with temperature. In the graph to the left it is clear that in areas (such as the Northern Territory and Queensland), 
          that they experience high rainfall and that they have high maximum and minimum temperatures. Similarly, areas which experience moderate rainfall (such as Victoria & Tasmania), 
        have moderate minimum and maximum temperatures. </p>

        <p> The graph to the right is interactive. The states in the legend can be selected to filter the graph, and there is a selector bar below the graph. </p>

        <p> The below graphs highlight different weather patterns in Australia from which conclusions can be drawn. Interestingly, the Northern Territory and Northern Queensland where the most rain is experienced, there is also the highest wind gusts.
          The graph to the right shows a count of the days when there was rain and when there wasn't rain. This graph can also be filtered by states to highlight clearly the spread across the states.

        <p3>Melbourne</p3> is known for having some of the most temperature weather in the world. 
        From being in <p2>Australia</p2>, this means that <p3>Melbourne</p3> experiences the high temperatures in the summer. While being a coastal city means there is also a lot of wind. 
        <p3>Melbourne</p3> is known for experiencing 4 seasons in a day which is often seen in the height of Spring, with the days starting with sun and ending with rain! </p>

    <p align = "center"> 
        The below graphs are specific to <p3>Melbourne</p3>. The first graph shows how the temperature changes over <p3>Melbourne</p3> over the course of a year (2014). 
        The second graph shows the amount of rainfall that each Victorian location had in 2014.
